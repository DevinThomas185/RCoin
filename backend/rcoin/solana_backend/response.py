This module contains an abstraction of a response received from any
api call that is sent to the blockchain. A response can either be
a Success or Failure which wraps around the actual contents of the
response.

In case of failure, we expect the contents of the response to be some
sort of an exception which implements the __str__ method that should
contain a user-friendly description of the error.
