## Motivation
RCoin is a mobile banking app for Eswatini, using an underlying stablecoin. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is pegged to a real currency; for RCoin, the South African Rand. The real time audit provides users with confidence that the stablecoin is always backed by sufficient reserve currency, ensuring that they can withdraw their money at any time.

By utilising blockchain technology, we can ensure lower fees than traditional methods while maintaining a consistent transaction ledger. RCoin is also designed to function like a regular banking app, reassuring users that they do not need ot learn about the complex details of blockchains.

RCoin was developed in just 8 weeks, during which we were able to get the app demoed in Eswatini and presented to the Minister of Finance!

As a result of our work, we were awarded the Ocado Technology Group Project Prize, one of only three group prizes offered at Imperial. We were also invited to present our work at the Mandarin Oriental for the Imperial Business School / Brevan Howard Annual Crypto Showcase.
